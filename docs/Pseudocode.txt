Navigation Loop:

    Read Speed from Accelerometer...

every so often read sensors, check battery

speed min, speed max -> stay as close to max speed
Part of course with line
part of course with no line -> cone hides gps module, go toward cone coordinates
course with objects, avoid objects -> be within line 

if no lines, go to gps coordinates
depth sensing camera to detect objects 

Control Loop:
    if Battery Level is below 50%
        increase speed to make constant speed
    if battery level is below 25%
        increase speed even more
    if Incline level is above 2%
        Increase speed
    if decline level is above 2%
        decrease speed
Object Detection:
    if sensor sees 2 objects
        if distance between two objects is greater than vehicle_width
            steer vehicle in between objects
    if sensor sees only 1 object
        steer vehicle away from object
    if sensor sees 3+ objects
        find distance between objects and compare with vehicle_width
            steer vehicle in between the 2 objects with greatest distance
