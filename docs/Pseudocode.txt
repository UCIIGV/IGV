Navigation Loop:

    Read Speed from Accelerometer...

every so often read sensors, check battery

speed min, speed max -> stay as close to max speed
Part of course with line
part of course with no line -> cone hides gps module, go toward cone coordinates
course with objects, avoid objects -> be within line 

if no lines, go to gps coordinates
depth sensing camera to detect objects 

Control Loop:
    if Battery Level is below 50%
        increase speed to make constant speed
    if battery level is below 25%
        increase speed even more
    if Incline level is above 2%
        Increase speed
    if decline level is above 2%
        decrease speed
Object Detection:
    if sensor sees 2 objects
        if distance between two objects is greater than vehicle_width
            steer vehicle in between objects
    if sensor sees only 1 object
        steer vehicle away from object
    if sensor sees 3+ objects
        find distance between objects and compare with vehicle_width
            steer vehicle in between the 2 objects with greatest distance
           
Line Detection:
    Read line data from camera
    if both lines are equidistant from center of camera && lines veer straight ahead
        steer straight
    if right line is close to vehicle 
        steer left 
    if left line is close to vehicle
        steer right
    if right line curves left and distance from right line is X
        steer left
    if left line curves right and distance from left line is X
        steer right   
Cone Tracking:
    Read cone coordinates
    Read vehicle gps coordinates
    Read line data from camera 
    Read object detection from depth sensor
    if object is detected && close enough to vehicle
        steer away from object 
    else
    if vehicle_x_coordinate is right of cone_x_coordinate
        steer left 
    if vehicle_x_coordinate is left of cone_x_coordinate
        steer right
    if vehicle_x_coordinate = cone_x_coordinate  
        steer straight
    if lines are detected && close enough to vehicle
        end cone tracking
